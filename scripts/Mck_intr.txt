McKinsey &amp; Company is interested in evaluating:
1. Problem solving approach
2. Ability to make realistic assumptions
3. Calculations i.e. comfort with numbers

Example: What is the revenue of PVR Saket in a week?
1. What are the sources of revenue
Example:

a) Ticket Sales
b) Food and Beverage Sales
c) Sales from Advertising/Promotion
 On Screen
 In theatre i.e. off screen

SELECT SUM(amount) from (
SELECT txn_amount as amount from ticket_sales 
UNION ALL 
SELECT txn_amount as amount from Food_and_Beverage_Sales 
UNION ALL
SELECT txn_amount as amount from adv_sales ) 

2. For each one figure out best way to calculate
Example:

a) Ticket Sales

Assumptions:
 PVR is a multiplex and has (Assume)

4 screens of approx 100 seats each i.e. 400 seats

 Each hall screen has 5 shows a day

i.e. Max of 400*5 i.e. 2000 Tickets can be sold each day
 Make realistic assumptions on “OCCUPA” depending on

i. Day of week
ii. Time of day
Assume its 70-75%
Therefore, number of tickets sold= approx 1400 per day
And in a week number of tickets sold =9800(1400*7) i.e. approx 10,000
Hence, At RsX(Put a number) per ticket, Ticket sales Revenue=10,000*(Put a number)

This example was just to give you an idea, how to solve such problem solving issues.

Few other examples are:
1. Number of burgers sold by McDonalds in a day
2. Litres of petrol sold by X petrol pump in a day
	
3. Number of vehicles crossing the toll a day
4. Number of golf balls in Delhi
